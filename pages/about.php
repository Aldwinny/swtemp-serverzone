The company was bought by six BSIT students in 2006. The Server Zone is about 15 years old, it is not older than the other business company. This company provides the customers with the latest computer parts that they can buy from the market and to satisfy the needs of the customers.</p>
                            <p> Our company seeks out high quality computer components, maintains the strictest quality standards in the industry, and has an unshakable commitment to lift up the technology industry in our country. Our goal is to bring quality products to bring out the innate potential of our customers.</p>
                            <p> We created a website that sells computer components through online. This will help the customers build their system units and dream computer sets which can be used for various uses like work, academics, entertainment, and more. Because of the ongoing pandemic, people are not allowed to go outside of their house, so we decided to make a website through online in an easy and convenient way. As years goes by our company continues to grow and be recognized all over the country and even around the world.</p>
